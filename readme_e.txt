Programs Structure:

root:
  makefiles, this readme.txt, relnotes_e.txt, and license files.

/build:
  makefile definitions

/doc : 
  documentation

/include:
  include directory - contains the top level reference header dae.h

   /dae:
     contains all of the COLLADA object model header and base interface 
     header files.

   /1.3:
   /dom:
     	  contains all of the generated COLLADA C++ dom object header files for v1.3

   /modules:
     contains implementation header files for COLLADA reference plug-in
     implementations for the daeDatabase and the backend IO Plug-in

/samples: 
   
   /integration:
