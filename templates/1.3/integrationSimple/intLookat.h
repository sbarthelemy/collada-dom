/** The lookat element contains a position and orientation transformation suitable for aiming a 
			camera. Positioning and orienting a camera or object in the scene is often complicated when 
			using a matrix. A lookat transform is an intuitive way to specify an eye position, interest 
			point, and orientation. The lookat element contains a list of 9 floating-point values. As 
			in the OpenGLÂ® Utilities (GLU) implementation, these values are organized into three vectors 
			as follows:
			* Eye position is given as Px, Py, Pz.
			* Interest point is given as Ix, Iy, Iz.
			* Up-axis direction is given as UPx, UPy, UPz.
			When computing the equivalent (viewing) matrix the interest point is mapped to the negative 
			Z-axis and the eye position to the origin. The up-axis is mapped to the positive Y-axis of 
			the viewing plane. The values are specified in local, object coordinates.
