We are providing 2 template of integration library generated from the schema.

integrationFull: contains all the collada objects
integrationSimple: doesn't contain the xml "inline" object.

To use an integration library, you don't have to implement all the classes.
You need to pick the objects you need out of Collada and implement only those classes.
Then you need to modify ( and rename ) the main header integrationFull.h or integrationSimple.h
to match the list of class you have implemented in your integration library.
same for the makefile / and or Visual Studio project.

SEE the sample "integrationViewer". It is a very simple integration library which only implements
the intGeometry object. It allows the sample "colladaViewer" to draw the geometry.
