COLLADA 1.4.1 DOM 1.1.0

This DOM provides import and export capabilities to tools that process
COLLADA v1.4.1 or COLLADA v1.3.1 documents.

======================================================================
Restriction 
======================================================================
* [Guideline] 
  Issue reporting is done using the Sourceforge bug tracking database hosted at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/collada-dom .

* [Guideline]
  Refer to the COLLADA_DOM-Programming_Guide.pdf user documention for further information.
  Refer to the COLLADA_DOM.chm reference documentation for online help.

* [Limitation]
  A common problem will be that domListOfFloats is actually a daeDoubleArray since COLLADA 
  defines a float as xs:Double. Be carefull when accessing or copying memory directly.

* [Guideline]
  The rule for enum names is ENUMTYPE_VALUE to avoid collisions with 
  #defines and enums defined in the schema with duplicate values.
  
* [Limitation]
  You cannot build and use the 1.3.1 and 1.4.1 versions of the DOM simultaneously.
  
* [Limitation]
  To build for Windows you will need to download libxml2 from the web and install
  them yourself.

  Pre-built win32 binaries are available for libxml2, iconv and zlib.  All these
  are available from http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html and should be installed
  by copying the lib and include directories from these distributions into the 
  lib and include subdirectories COLLADA_DOM/external-libs/libxml2/win32

  Windows applications also need to link in wsock32 as libxml2 supports networking.

  When linking debug builts against the prebuilt libxml2 libraries, you will see
  a linker warning about MSVCRT, this can be safely ignored.  The warning appears
  because the prebuil libxml2 doesn't supply a debug version of the library, so we
  link with the release version.

* [Guideline]
  A new function "getDomVersion" was added to DAE after the documentation was finalized.
  This returns a text string (ie 1.3.1) that indicates the version of the COLLADA
  schema that was used to build the DOM.  Applications that depend on a specific
  schema version should check this.

* [Guideline]
  All load, save, query and other DOM calls that expect a document URI or a collection
  name now use URIs.  Remember to change backslashes to forward slashes and place
  file:/// or / in front of absolute URIs.

* [Guideline]
  You can now toggle automatic loading of external documents by calling 
  daeURIResolver::setAutoLoadExternalReferences(). 
  You can now get a list of external references contained within a document by calling 
  document->getReferencedDocuments(). With automatic loading turned off and the list of 
  external documents you reference, the client program has a lot more control over what 
  gets loaded and when.

* [Guideline]
  Added a new class, daeSIDResolver, that will resolve SID targets. This class does not 
  resolve elements automatically like the daeURI and daeIDRef resolver classes. If you 
  want to use this functionality create a daeSIDResolver passing in a pointer to the element
  that contains the target string, the target string, and optionally a platform string. A
  NULL platform string will cause the SID resolver to search through the COMMON techniques.
